# Specification Quality Checklist: 008 — Equalizer & Preset Manager

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-09-20  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) beyond toolchain requirements
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders and developers
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic where appropriate
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified (rapid toggle, corrupted custom presets, built-in immutability)
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded (10-band EQ, preset management, clipping protection)
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification inappropriately

## Notes

- Feature 008 evolui o equalizador da Feature 000 (Baseline) e se integra à UI (Feature 010).
- Todas as validações passaram com sucesso.
