# Specification Quality Checklist: 009 — FFT / Spectrum / Waveform Visualizer

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-09-20  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) beyond toolchain requirements
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders and developers
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic where appropriate
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified (silence, mono vs stereo, high-DPI scaling)
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded (FFT calculation, spectrum rendering, efficiency guardrail)
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification inappropriately

## Notes

- Feature 009 depende do pipeline de áudio da Feature 000 (Baseline) e se integra à UI (Feature 010).
- Todas as validações passaram com sucesso.
